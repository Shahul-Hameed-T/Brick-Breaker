# Brick-Breaker
This game is developed using Java programming language. And I have used Swing and awt packages for GUI. 

In this game there are totally 21 Bricks , a Ball and a Paddle. The Left and Right arrow keys are used to move the paddle.
If the ball hits the paddle ,It will reflects to the opposite direction.
Each brick holds 5 points if the ball hits the brick then 5 points added to score.
If the ball goes under the paddle, you lost the game.
Otherwise if you hit every bricks in this game , then you won the game.
Either you won or lost , hit enter to reset the game and continue playing.
